 *
 *  These events are generated when the evaluation of an actionpoint
 *  results in sending a command to the stored command (SC) processor
 *  to start a real time command sequence (RTS).  The event text is
 *  user defined and specific to the particular actionpoint.
 *
 *  Note that user defined event ID's can be easily recognized if the
 *  base number is easily recognizable.  For example, using the value
 *  1000 for the base event ID and using the actionpoint table index as
 *  the offset portion creates an obvious correlation.  Thus, if an LC
 *  event ID is 1025 then it is immediately apparent that the event is
